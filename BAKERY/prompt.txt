hello! 
so I am going to make an app using Java and Servlet as traitement pages. I will use POstgres as database.
I am going to make it in a folder that is mvc (controller,models,etc)
This is the sujet.
So It is a factory where we construct beds from foam(eponge de lit).
Basically, at the beginning I will have a block, then I will transform it into smaller blocks
(beds,etc).
The transformed blocks have an usual form 
U1 
U2 
U3 
U4 
note that the transformed blocks have a (Longeur,Largeur,Hauteur,PrixDeVente,PrixDeRevient)
the original blocks have (Longeur,Largeur,Hauteur,PrixDeRevient)
what we will do is some crud concerning these.

First we will make an insertion page for new blocks with fields:
name 
Longeur 
Largeur 
Hauteur 
Prix Revient 

Second we will have a page transformation Block with fields
block (selecting existing blocks)
(then after lists of the usual form of blocks, for instance:
U1
U2
U2
U3
U4)
next to each usual blocks there will be a quantity (which means that from the block selected up I will make X number of this usual smaller block)

It will also have an area called Reste with fields:
Longeur:
Largeur
Hauteur:

Our concept in this is that the one who inserts these is supposed to have already calculated what he is putting in 
Basically from the quantity of U that he chose based on their volume and their volume this is what it should check 

volume of the original block selected - (Volume of U1 * quantity of U1+Volume of U2 * quantity of U2+Volume of U3 * quantity of U3+Volume of U4 * quantity of U4 + reste) 
MUST BE LESS THAN 2 PERCENT OF THE VOLUME OF THE BLOCK

Third page:
It is an affichage of all of the Usual blocks that have been transformed ever since. (not the original block then but the usual little blocks transformed after a big block)
With that we will show a table with columns (block name,quantity,PrixDeRevientTotal,PrixDeVenteTotal,quantity,MoyennePondere[PrixDeRevientTotal/quantity])


Forth page:
It is to affiche what is the maxProfit transformation that will be done with the reste of each bloscks that have been transformed 
So to know which usual type of block will profit the max, the calculation will be to compare 
PrixDeRevient/volume of each kind . The biggest of these will be the type of usual block that will bring the max profit.
after that then, from each reste, it will show how many of that kind of usual block can each reste of block make 

for instance the most profitable is U3,
then I have 
BigBlockReste1 , can make 0 pieces of U3
BigBlockReste2 , can make 1 pieces of U3
BigBlockReste3, can make 5 pieces of U3

Fifth Page:
It will show the list of usual blocks transformed from the reste of each big transformed BigBlock, in which the least volume is lost in the reste 
So how can we use the most volume from the reste

Knowing all of that. 
Please help me start my project. 
Dont do anything yet, just wanted to give u a backstory of what we are going to do.
I will do each of these step by step.
